SPLASH DAMAGE (For melee weapons)

There are two folders, and they need to go in two different places
First we will add the files to randomizer source files, these are:

SetItems.txt
Sets.txt
Uniqueitems.txt
(Found in "Put this in randomizer source folder")
Place these files and overwrite them inside "source" folder in Randomizer

Next we will add the required files to the diablo 2 folder
I have already made the structure, so open "Put this in d2 folder"
and copy the whole "data" folder.
Now locate your Diablo 2 folder and place it there
If you have an existing data folder from randomizer only, you can merge it still (Not compatible with other mods)

Thats it!



NOTE:
Unique and set items that have splash will also be randomized.
