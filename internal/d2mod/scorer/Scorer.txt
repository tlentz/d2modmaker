The Scorer read all items fed to it and sums the scores for each property looked up from PropScores.txt.

The score is calculated by taking the average of the Prop min & max values and scaling that interpolating the result 
from the PropScores Min & Max (*) into ScoreMax and ScoreMin.
Beware that which columns in PropScores that are used for Min & Max values vary by PropParType.

The Scorer also keeps track of how many times each line in PropScores.txt was used by the following item classes (scorerstatistics:categories.go):
- Weapons
- Armor
- jewelry
- Full set bonuses
- other

This information is used by the Generator to weight the probabilities of rolling a mod for an item type.

The Scorer will reduce the score of properties that are partial or full set bonuses.
It will also reduce the score for all 2-handed weapons that can't be wielded 1-handed.

When the Scorer reads the PropScores.txt file in it keeps a index of all the props by name.  When a prop is read from an item file it scans every matching 
PropScores line with that name starting from the first one encountered during read until it finds a match in both Min-Max and itype & etype.
