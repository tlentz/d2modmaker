The Generator will randomly generate new affixes for items fed to it.
It will duplicate UniqueItems.txt up to NumClones times, except items that are disabled, quest items or dividers.

Prop rolling:
It will pick a target prop count and target item score based on the vanilla item.  

For each property:
It will calculate a target property score = 60% * (target item score - sum(already rolled prop scores))

It will then roll a new PropScoreLine using a weighted distribution based on the # 
of times a PropScoreLine was seen by the Scorer for that item type.
If the Line is not suitable (item req level is < MinLvl, itype/etype doesn't match, etc) the prop is rerolled.

For the rolled Line, it will then roll the Min and Max values(*) based on interpolation of +/-20 % around the target property score.
(*) For some PropParTypes, the Minimum value is 0, for some what is rolled is Par (%/lvl).
