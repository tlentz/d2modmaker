# D2 Mod Maker

The idea behind this project is to play Diablo II the way that you want to play.  Every option in the `ModConfig` is optional.

# PlugY and Things
This should be compatible with PlugY and other things such as:
* [PlugY](http://plugy.free.fr/en/index.html) by Yohann Nicolas.
* [MultiRes / BH](https://www.reddit.com/r/slashdiablo/comments/7z5uy1/hd_mod_and_maphack_new_release/) by SlashDiablo.

# ModConfig

The mod config is located in `cfg.json`.  You can change this config to your liking to produce a new `data` folder.

## ModConfig Options
* **SourceDir** `string`
    * Specifies the directory the source text files are read from
    * If this is omitted, or set to "", the built-in 113c data files will be used. 
* **IncreaseStackSizes** `bool`
    * Increases book of tp to 100
    * Increases book of id to 100
    * Increases arrows maxstack to 511
    * Increases bolts maxstack to 511
    * Increases key stack sizes to 100
* **IncreaseMonsterDensity** `float`
    * Will increase the density of all areas by the given multiplier
    * `MAX: 30.0`
    * `MIN: 0.0`
    * Set to `-1` to omit
* **EnableTownSkills** `bool`
    * Enables all skills in town
* **NoDropZero** `bool`
    * Sets "NoDrop" = 0 (Monsters will always drop items)
* **QuestDrops** `bool`
    * Enables quest drops for boss kills always
* **UniqueItemDropRate** `float`
    * Will increase the rate in which uniques/sets drop
    * When using this setting, high values will prevent some monsters from dropping set items.
        * Act bosses at approximately 10
        * Mini bosses at approximately 85
        * Other special monsters at approximately 200
        * All other monsters at approximately 450
    * Set to `-1` to omit
* **RuneDropRate** `float`
    * Valid values are from 1 (vanilla drop rate) - 100 (even chance for all runes)
    * Does not change the maximum rune any enemy can drop.
    * Scales exponetially:
        * Each increase of 1 raises the drop rate of the highest runes by ~5% cumulatively
        * E.g. Zod is 12.5x more common at 50 (1/418), and 156x (1/33) more common at 100.
* **StartWithCube** `bool`
    * Characters will start with cube when created
* **Cowzzz** `bool`
    * Enables ability to kill cow king and still make cow portal
    * Adds ability to cube 1 town portal scroll to make the cow portal
* **EnterToExit** `bool`
    * If this is true, this will require the user to press enter to close the program
    * If false, it will not prompt user input
* **RandomOptions** `RandomOptions`
    * **Randomize** `bool`
        * Will randomize if set to true
    * **Seed** `int`
        * Will use this seed for randomization
        * Set to `-1` to generate a random seed
    * **IsBalanced** `bool`
        * Allows props only from items within 10 levels of the base item so that you don't get crazy hell stats on normal items, but still get a wide range of randomization
    * **AllowDuplicateProps** `bool`
        * If this value is false, the same prop type will not be placed on an item twice
        * E.g. two instances of all resist will not get stacked on the same randomized item
    * **BalancedPropCount** `bool`
        * Pick prop count on items based on counts from vanilla items
        * Picks from items up to 10 levels higher when randomizing
        * Enabling this setting will make MinProps and MaxProps unused
    * **MinProps** `int`
        * Minimum number of non blank props that spawn on an item
        * Set to `-1` to omit
    * **MaxProps** `int`
        * Maximum number of non blank props that spawn on an item
        * Set to `-1` to omit
    * **UseOSkills** `bool`
        * Will change class only skills to oskills
    * **PerfectProps** `bool`
        * All props will have the max value for min/max values

# How to use UI
1. Launch d2modmaker binary
2. Go to http://localhost:8148
3. Press `Load Config`
4. Change all the things
5. Save Config
6. Run

**NOTE** The d2modmaker binary must be in the same directory as the `cfg.json`, and both the `templates` and `react-ui` folders.

**NOTE** `Load Config` will read the `cfg.json` in the same directory as the d2modmaker binary into the UI.

**NOTE** `Save Config` will write `cfg.json` to the same directory as the d2modmaker binary

**NOTE** `Run` will run the program with the current `cfg.json` loaded into the UI.  If you want to save the cfg that you just ran, you need to press `Save Config`

# Change Log


## v0.5.1

* Fixed an issue that caused 1.14 game to crash with Cowzzz option enabled.

## v0.5.0
* Randomization has been reworked. Old seeds are invalidated.
* Refactors IsBalanced mode
   * Now item properties are selected from items up to 10 levels above
   * This replaces the 0-30, 31-60, and 61+ buckets
* Fixes bugs with Runeword property parsing and randomizing
   * Runeword props were previously always added to the 0-30 bucket, allowing them on all items regardles of runeword levels
   * Runewords were previously assigned props only from the 0-30 bucket.
   * Runeword properties and randomization are now assigned by the level requirement of their highest rune.
* Adds a new randomization option: BalancedPropCount
   * This option enables picking the prop count for items from the counts on vanilla items
   * The count is pulled from items up to 10 levels above the item being randomized
   * The MinProps and MaxProps settings will be ignored if this is enabled
* Adds a new randomization option: AllowDuplicateProps
   * If this property is false (default), the same property type will not be added to an item twice (e.g. two instances of resist all)
* Prevents two auras from being placed on the same item. This is bugged in the game, and one aura would not work.
* Adds an option to specify the directory to read source Diablo 2 text files from instead of using the built-in 1.13c data.
* Adds an option to specify the output directory.
* NEW USER INTERFACE!
![v0.5.0_ux](/images/v0.5.0_ux.png)

## v0.4.0
* Adds new feature `MeleeSplash`
   * This enables `Splash Damage` as an affix on jewels.
   * Can spawn on any magic or rare jewel.
   * ![Melee Splash](https://i.imgur.com/7qqDycZ.png)

## v0.3.4
* Fixed an issue where `MaxProps` was effectively one less than the configured value
   * This will invalidate most seeds
   * If MaxProps was 7 or less, the seed can be preserved by setting it to one less than the previous value

## v0.3.3
* Added new option to cfg
	* **RuneDropRate** 'float'
		* Scales Rune drop rates from vanilla to even chance per rune.

## v0.3.2
* Fixed an issue where `MinProps` and `MaxProps` weren't working correctly
   * This may invalidate seeds that were using these options

## v0.3.1
* Fixed an issue where unique drop rate multipliers less than 10 would actually reduce drop rates

## v0.3.0
* Fixed an issue where seeding wasn't working correctly
* Fixed an issue where `IncreaseMonsterDensity` couldn't be a value between 0 and 1

## v0.2.0
* Fixed issue where buckets were incorrect for the `IsBalanced` option.
* Added new option to cfg
    * **EnterToExit** `bool`
        * If this is true, this will require the user to press enter to close the program
        * If false, it will not prompt user input

## v0.1.6
* **Cowzzz** `bool`
    * Enables ability to kill cow king and still make cow portal
    * Adds ability to cube 1 town portal scroll to make the cow portal
